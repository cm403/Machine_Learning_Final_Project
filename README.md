The ATLAS experiment at CERN observes signals of the Higgs boson's existence through it's decay into two tau particles. This signal is hard to pick up due to background noise. 

### Main Goal:  
Predict signals from background noise.

#### Other Goals:  
Analyze features and clean up data   
Investigate and determine AUCROC   
Compare Logistic Regression results for different processing of data  
Investigate Gradient Boosted Tree models through Microsoft's LightGBM
