# Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge
Kaggle Competition 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson

The ATLAS experiment at CERN observes signals of the Higgs boson's existence through it's decay into two tau particles. This signal is hard to pick up due to background noise. 

### Main Goal:  
Predict signals from background noise.

#### Other Goals:  
Analyze features and clean up data   
Investigate and determine AUCROC   
Compare Logistic Regression results for different processing of data  
Investigate Gradient Boosted Tree models with Microsoft's LightGBM
